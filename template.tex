\title{AAAI Press Anonymous Submission\\
Instructions for Authors Using {\LaTeX}}
\author{Sarah Malloc \and Eliza Dealloc}
\date{}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
AAAI creates proceedings, working notes, and technical reports directly
from electronic source furnished by the authors. To ensure that all
papers in the publication have a uniform appearance, authors must adhere
to the following instructions.
\end{abstract}


\subsection{Preparing an Anonymous
Submission}\label{preparing-an-anonymous-submission}

This document details the formatting requirements for anonymous
submissions. The requirements are the same as for camera ready papers
but with a few notable differences:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The PDF document's metadata should be cleared with a metadata-cleaning
  tool before submitting it. This is to prevent leaked information from
  revealing your identity.
\item
  References must be anonymized whenever the reader can infer that they
  are to the authors' previous work.
\item
  AAAI's copyright notice should not be included as a footer in the
  first page.
\item
  Only the PDF version is required at this stage. No source versions
  will be requested, nor any copyright transfer form.
\end{itemize}

You can remove the copyright notice and ensure that your names aren't
shown by including \texttt{submission} option when loading the
\texttt{aaai2026} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}documentclass}\NormalTok{[letterpaper]\{}\ExtensionTok{article}\NormalTok{\}}
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}usepackage}\NormalTok{[submission]\{}\ExtensionTok{aaai2026}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The remainder of this document are the original camera-ready
instructions. Any contradiction of the above points ought to be ignored
while preparing anonymous submissions.

\subsection{Camera-Ready Guidelines}\label{camera-ready-guidelines}

Congratulations on having a paper selected for inclusion in an AAAI
Press proceedings or technical report! This document details the
requirements necessary to get your accepted paper published using
PDF{\LaTeX}. If you are using Microsoft Word, instructions are provided
in a different document. AAAI Press does not support any other
formatting software.

The instructions herein are provided as a general guide for experienced
{\LaTeX} users. If you do not know how to use {\LaTeX}, please obtain
assistance locally. AAAI cannot provide you with support and the
accompanying style files are \textbf{not} guaranteed to work. If the
results you obtain are not in accordance with the specifications you
received, you must correct your source file to achieve the correct
result.

These instructions are generic. Consequently, they do not include
specific dates, page charges, and so forth. Please consult your specific
written conference instructions for details regarding your submission.
Please review the entire document for specific instructions that might
apply to your particular situation. All authors must comply with the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You must use the 2026 AAAI Press {\LaTeX} style file and the
  aaai2026.bst bibliography style files, which are located in the 2026
  AAAI Author Kit (aaai2026.sty, aaai2026.bst).
\item
  You must complete, sign, and return by the deadline the AAAI copyright
  form (unless directed by AAAI Press to use the AAAI Distribution
  License instead).
\item
  You must read and format your paper source and PDF according to the
  formatting instructions for authors.
\item
  You must submit your electronic files and abstract using our
  electronic submission form \textbf{on time.}
\item
  You must pay any required page or formatting charges to AAAI Press so
  that they are received by the deadline.
\item
  You must check your paper before submitting it, ensuring that it
  compiles without error, and complies with the guidelines found in the
  AAAI Author Kit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Copyright}\label{copyright}

All papers submitted for publication by AAAI Press must be accompanied
by a valid signed copyright form. They must also contain the AAAI
copyright notice at the bottom of the first page of the paper. There are
no exceptions to these requirements. If you fail to provide us with a
signed copyright form or disable the copyright notice, we will be unable
to publish your paper. There are \textbf{no exceptions} to this policy.
You will find a PDF version of the AAAI copyright form in the AAAI
AuthorKit. Please see the specific instructions for your conference for
submission details.

\subsection{Formatting Requirements in
Brief}\label{formatting-requirements-in-brief}

We need source and PDF files that can be used in a variety of ways and
can be output on a variety of devices. The design and appearance of the
paper is strictly governed by the aaai style file (aaai2026.sty).
\textbf{You must not make any changes to the aaai style file, nor use
any commands, packages, style files, or macros within your own paper
that alter that design, including, but not limited to spacing, floats,
margins, fonts, font size, and appearance.} AAAI imposes requirements on
your source and PDF files that must be followed. Most of these
requirements are based on our efforts to standardize conference
manuscript properties and layout. All papers submitted to AAAI for
publication will be recompiled for standardization purposes.
Consequently, every paper submission must comply with the following
requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your .tex file must compile in PDF{\LaTeX} --- (you may not include
  .ps or .eps figure files.)
\item
  All fonts must be embedded in the PDF file --- including your figures.
\item
  Modifications to the style file, whether directly or via commands in
  your document may not ever be made, most especially when made in an
  effort to avoid extra page charges or make your paper fit in a
  specific number of pages.
\item
  No type 3 fonts may be used (even in illustrations).
\item
  You may not alter the spacing above and below captions, figures,
  headings, and subheadings.
\item
  You may not alter the font sizes of text elements, footnotes, heading
  elements, captions, or title information (for references and
  mathematics, please see the limited exceptions provided herein).
\item
  You may not alter the line spacing of text.
\item
  Your title must follow Title Case capitalization rules (not sentence
  case).
\item
  {\LaTeX} documents must use the Times or Nimbus font package (you may
  not use Computer Modern for the text of your paper).
\item
  No {\LaTeX} 209 documents may be used or submitted.
\item
  Your source must not require use of fonts for non-Roman alphabets
  within the text itself. If your paper includes symbols in other
  languages (such as, but not limited to, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew,
  Japanese, Thai, Russian and other Cyrillic languages), you must
  restrict their use to bit-mapped figures. Fonts that require
  non-English language support (CID and Identity-H) must be converted to
  outlines or 300 dpi bitmap or removed from the document (even if they
  are in a graphics file embedded in the document).
\item
  Two-column format in AAAI style is required for all papers.
\item
  The paper size for final submission must be US letter without
  exception.
\item
  The source file must exactly match the PDF.
\item
  The document margins may not be exceeded (no overfull boxes).
\item
  The number of pages and the file size must be as specified for your
  event.
\item
  No document may be password protected.
\item
  Neither the PDFs nor the source may contain any embedded links or
  bookmarks (no hyperref or navigator packages).
\item
  Your source and PDF must not have any page numbers, footers, or
  headers (no pagestyle commands).
\item
  Your PDF must be compatible with Acrobat 5 or higher.
\item
  Your {\LaTeX} source file (excluding references) must consist of a
  \textbf{single} file (use of the ``input'' command is not allowed.
\item
  Your graphics must be sized appropriately outside of {\LaTeX} (do not
  use the \texttt{clip"\ or}trim'\,' command) .
\end{itemize}

If you do not follow these requirements, your paper will be returned to
you to correct the deficiencies.

\subsection{What Files to Submit}\label{what-files-to-submit}

You must submit the following items to ensure that your paper is
published:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A fully-compliant PDF file.
\item
  Your {\LaTeX} source file submitted as a \textbf{single} .tex file (do
  not use the ``input'' command to include sections of your paper ---
  every section must be in the single source file). (The only allowable
  exception is .bib file, which should be included separately).
\item
  The bibliography (.bib) file(s).
\item
  Your source must compile on our system, which includes only standard
  {\LaTeX} 2020 TeXLive support files.
\item
  Only the graphics files used in compiling paper.
\item
  The {\LaTeX}-generated files (e.g.~.aux, .bbl file, PDF, etc.).
\end{itemize}

Your {\LaTeX} source will be reviewed and recompiled on our system (if
it does not compile, your paper will be returned to you. \textbf{Do not
submit your source in multiple text files.} Your single {\LaTeX} source
file must include all your text, your bibliography (formatted using
aaai2026.bst), and any custom macros.

Your files should work without any supporting files (other than the
program itself) on any computer with a standard {\LaTeX} distribution.

\textbf{Do not send files that are not actually used in the paper.}
Avoid including any files not needed for compiling your paper,
including, for example, this instructions file, unused graphics files,
style files, additional material sent for the purpose of the paper
review, intermediate build files and so forth.

\textbf{Obsolete style files.} The commands for some common packages
(such as some used for algorithms), may have changed. Please be certain
that you are not compiling your paper using old or obsolete style files.

\textbf{Final Archive.} Place your source files in a single archive
which should be compressed using .zip. The final file size may not
exceed 10 MB. Name your source file with the last (family) name of the
first author, even if that is not you.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Using {\LaTeX} to Format Your
Paper}{Using  to Format Your Paper}}\label{using-to-format-your-paper}

The latest version of the AAAI style file is available on AAAI's
website. Download this file and place it in the \TeX~search path.
Placing it in the same directory as the paper should also work. You must
download the latest version of the complete AAAI Author Kit so that you
will have the latest instruction set and style file.
